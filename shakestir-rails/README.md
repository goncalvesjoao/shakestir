# ShakeStir Rails

## Local development

With the project's mise Ruby active, set up the Ruby dependencies and database:

```sh
bin/setup --skip-server
bin/dev
```

This starts Rails at `http://localhost:3000`. Press Ctrl+C to stop it.
To use a different port, run `PORT=3001 bin/dev`.

Stylesheets are served by Rails through Propshaft; Node and npm are not required.
Semanticus CSS 3.4.1 is vendored in `app/assets/stylesheets/semanticus.css` from
`@semanticus/semanticus-css`'s `dist/semanticus.css`. Its license and notices are
in `vendor/semanticus/`. To update it, replace the compiled CSS and notices from
the desired npm release. The layout loads it before the local stylesheets in
an explicit order. This 3.4.1 bundle was built with `npm run build:full` from
the Semanticus source commit `c0187a7` because npm did not yet expose that version
at update time. Built-in `.button` support now styles navigation anchors; the local
button-style adapter has been removed. The theme sets `--buttons-border-radius`
to `3rem`, independently of the general `.7rem` radius; circular and rectangular
controls override that button-specific token locally. The vendored version banner
was corrected to 3.4.1 because the source banner still identified 3.4.0.
Compact filter chips and checklist resets use Semanticus `.size-sm`; library actions
and star controls use `.size-md` with the theme defaults. App-specific minimum tap
targets remain in the local stylesheets.
Secondary buttons and button-styled navigation links share a scoped near-white
Semanticus `.secondary` theme; other secondary components retain their palettes.

## Recipes and ownership

`Cocktail` represents a canonical drink identity with a name, description and history. It has many recipes. An optional `parent_cocktail_id` links a variant to its parent cocktail; `variants` exposes its children. Cycles are rejected, and deleting a parent clears the link on its variants.

`Recipe` represents a preparation shared by its author. It contains required `user_id` and optional `cocktail_id`, preparation metadata, ingredients, utensils, ordered steps and an optional photo. Servings default to one.

Every recipe belongs to a user. Seeded recipes belong to the public `@shakestir` account, identified by a trusted `system_key` of `shakestir`. ShakeStir-authored recipes follow the same rules and appear in the same lists as every other recipe. Recipes have no parent or variant relationship; cocktail assignment groups versions of the same drink.

`RecipePolicy` permits public reads of complete, public, published recipes. Owners can read their own drafts and private recipes and edit their recipes. The authoring endpoint always assigns new recipes to the signed-in user. Seeds create the ShakeStir account with the password `password`; public forms cannot set its system identity.

## Database setup

The original create migrations define the current schema directly, including content fields, recipe requirements and steps. No translation tables, language columns, compatibility migration or archive are created. Recreate the database after these migration changes. Use `bin/rails db:setup` to load the schema and seeds, or `bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed` to build it from migrations.

## Marketplace and sources

The homepage at `/cocktails` filters `Recipe.marketplace`, searching recipe names and linked canonical cocktail names. Results are individual recipes with exact recipe links and author handles, paginated 24 at a time in stable newest-first order. Lazy Turbo Frames preserve filters and provide a normal next-page link. JSON returns an array of recipe objects. Private recipes and drafts stay out of the marketplace even for owners; owners use My Recipes. `/recipes` also retains a flat recipe listing and the authoring endpoints. Cocktail pages list recipes from every author together; all filters apply equally. Cocktail JSON exposes matching `recipes` and filtered `other_recipes`, with no separate author category.

Handles are unique, editable in profile settings, and public attribution on published public recipes. New handles start from a normalized email local part; collisions receive a random suffix and unusable names fall back to `member`. The `shakestir` handle is reserved. Every author has a public profile. Profile pages always list only published public recipes and public collections, including for owners. Collection previews also exclude private recipes and drafts; owners manage those in My Recipes and My Collections. Email appears only in the owner-only My account page. Recipe photos take priority over linked readable cocktail photos, and canonical background is collapsed below the preparation.

Starring uses existing Favorites collection memberships. The `favorites` system key survives renaming, keeps the collection private, and prevents deletion. Saving through the collection picker and starring affect the same membership. Image-overlay controls show public Favorites-based star totals and update without page navigation. Counts include only memberships in system Favorites collections, regardless of their display name; other collections do not count. `recipes.stars_count` caches this total using transactional, atomic Active Record counter updates on Favorites membership creation and destruction. A standard unconditional association counter cache would include ordinary collection saves, so the callbacks filter to Favorites. Membership identities and collection system keys cannot be reassigned; remove and recreate memberships to move them. Views read the cached count and load only the current user’s starred recipe IDs once per request. Signed-out visitors can see totals and follow the star link to sign in. Star controls and the collection picker synchronize after changes, and ordinary form submissions work without JavaScript. Star ranking, forking, and automatic canonical matching are not implemented.

Publication requires a name, ingredient lines, and preparation steps. Every recipe requires an owner; cocktail assignment and a recipe photo are optional. Referenced ingredients and utensils must remain usable shared catalog identities with names and exclusive photos. Missing catalog content excludes affected recipes from public reads and availability searches.

`Recipe#published_at` records publication on ShakeStir. Both cocktails and recipes have optional `source_reference` and `source_url`: cocktail sources support identity, description and history; recipe sources credit quantities and instructions. Only cocktails have historical source dates. `source_published_on` stores an exact historical publication date when known; use `source_date_note` for approximate years, uncertain dates, or discovery context instead of inventing a day. Source URLs accept only HTTP or HTTPS.

## Content and requirements

Cocktails, recipes, ingredients, utensils and techniques store their content directly on their own records. Text is preserved as entered, with no language field or translation interface. `display_name` returns the stored name.

`.lookup(text)` matches exact normalized stored names. Recipe lookup is an internal matching operation; use `.marketplace.search(text)` for public discovery and `.readable_by(user)` when resolving a readable recipe. Normalization applies Unicode NFKC, lowercase, trimming, and collapsed whitespace, preserving display text.

`RecipeIngredient` preserves exact `submitted_text`, position, optionality, role, preparation notes, and optional positive quantity with measuring unit. Repeated ingredients are allowed. `RecipeUtensil` stores explicit requirements with submitted text. Ice is an ingredient.

`RecipeStep` stores ordered prose. `StepMention` associates character ranges with an ingredient or utensil, preserving the prose. Mentions do not establish requirements. Updating a step invalidates its mentions in the same transaction; mention saves check current prose under a lock.

```ruby
Recipe.makeable_with(ingredient_ids: [gin.id, ice.id], utensil_ids: [jigger.id])
```

Availability checks required ingredient and utensil identities, ignores optional ingredients, and accepts repeated/extra available IDs. It does not compare quantities or substitute ingredients.

## Seeds

`bin/rails db:seed` loads the original offline fixtures in [`../db/seeds/demo/`](../db/seeds/demo/README.md). Six fictional cocktail families have 24 system recipes and five author recipes, including private drafts and a nonalcoholic preparation. Structured ingredients, quantities, optional garnishes, required tools, techniques, ordered steps, mentions, collections and original transparent images exercise model relationships.

Source URLs use the reserved `shakestir.example` domain and identify synthetic records rather than external publications. The dataset contains original prose and generated images, not an imported recipe database. Existing records and uploaded images are preserved; use a fresh local database and storage for a clean demo.

## Photos

Recipe images are optional; catalog ingredient and utensil images are required. Uploads must be fresh file bytes, not existing blobs or signed IDs. Still JPEG, PNG, and WebP are accepted, up to 10 MB and 25 megapixels. The validator decodes bytes with libvips, rejects corrupt/animated files, and retains the saved image when a replacement fails.

`GET /recipes/:recipe_id/image?size=card` authorizes the recipe before redirecting to a temporary storage URL. `card` bounds WebP images to 320 by 240, `detail` to 1200 by 1200, and `original` delivers the validated original. Catalog endpoints are `/ingredients/:ingredient_id/image` and `/utensils/:utensil_id/image`. Delivery refuses shared blobs and returns `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

Issued storage URLs remain bearer access until expiry, normally five minutes, even if permissions subsequently change. Default Active Storage routes are disabled except signed disk downloads. Development uses `storage/`; tests use `tmp/storage/`. Back up database and storage together. Active Storage jobs must run to reclaim replaced files. Production remote storage is not configured.

## Current UI limits and checks

The form edits recipe content, source credits, visibility, publication state, and an optional photo. Canonical identities and assignments are maintained through seeds or trusted model access. Deleting an identity leaves its recipes unassigned and discoverable. Multiple structured steps are read-only in this form to prevent flattening. Ingredient/utensil requirement authoring and system-owned recipe creation currently use model access. Availability filters are available in Explore for ingredients and utensils, with include-selected and use-only-available modes. Automatic extraction from preparation prose is not implemented. The product/design review and page coverage are recorded in `design-review.md`.

Profile settings support optional JPEG, PNG, or WebP photo uploads with the same 10 MB / 25 megapixel validation as recipe photos. `GET /profiles/:id/image` publicly delivers profile photos through the existing validated-image endpoint. The profile page and account menu use the uploaded image, with the existing Gravatar fallback for the owner and initials for public visitors. Owners can remove a photo to restore the fallback. Profile images use existing Active Storage tables, so no migration is needed. Seeds attach cached fictional portraits for Leo and Alex and a still-life image for ShakeStir; existing uploads are preserved. Generation prompts and asset details live in `../db/seeds/avatars/README.md`.

`GET /my/account` shows the current user’s email; both it and `DELETE /my/account` require authentication and prevent page caching. The account dropdown links to this private page. Deletion requires the current password, uses the session’s user regardless of submitted IDs, and cascades through owned recipes, structured recipe data, collections, memberships, legacy likes, and all sessions in one transaction. Other users’ saves of deleted recipes are removed; stars on surviving recipes are decremented when Favorites memberships are removed. Profile and recipe attachments are detached on deletion and their blobs/files are purged through Active Storage jobs after commit. Run background jobs to complete file cleanup. Shared catalog records and other users’ content remain. Success clears the login cookie and session; dependency failures roll back data and retain the session.

Public registration is at `/registration/new`; sign-in is at `/session/new`. Password resets require Action Mailer configuration.

```sh
PARALLEL_WORKERS=1 bin/rails test
bin/rubocop
bin/rails zeitwerk:check
```

Use the project's mise Ruby. Tests do not verify production assets or browser appearance.

Development/test seeds also create fictional demo accounts (never seeded in production):

| Account | Email | Password | Content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leo Sterling, fictional star bartender | leo@shakestir.example | password | Public profile, three published signature recipes, Halloween Special, Christmas, and House Signatures collections |
| Alex Morgan, home bartender | alex@shakestir.example | password | Public profile, two private drafts, four private collections mixing personal and public recipes |

Demo seeds preserve existing accounts and recipes, including changed passwords, and fill missing collection memberships on repeat runs. Variant seeds use names rather than database IDs and preserve existing parent assignments.

Public discovery at `/` lists individual marketplace recipes with search, availability filters, and pagination. `/cocktails` is the canonical cocktail catalog: one card per identity, canonical-name search, and links to cocktail details without recipe stars or author attribution. Visitors see only identities with marketplace recipes. Both indexes support JSON.

## Seed taste expectations and folded migration history

Nullable integer `sweetness`, `sourness` and `bitterness` live in the original `CreateRecipes` migration, with SQL checks enforcing NULL or 0–5. The separate additive taste migration was removed at the product owner's explicit request for a fresh database rebuild; the schema version is `20261106000000`, the newest remaining migration. This history rewrite is not an automatic incremental upgrade for an old database. No developer database is dropped by the seed loader.


### Seed photo recovery

Fresh seed runs preserve pending image uploads until the outer seed transaction commits. Reruns fill missing system/demo recipe and matching canonical attachments without rewriting recipe content; existing uploaded images are preserved. If a seed blob exists but its file is missing, the cached original is restored in place only when checksum and byte size match, preserving the blob identity. A missing custom upload with different bytes is left alone rather than replaced by an unrelated cached image. All five demo photos use their relevant cached canonical drink photograph; Snowfall Sidecar uses `sidecar.jpg`, which is present in the repository. The image regression test verifies committed files in isolated storage, not just `image.attached?` inside a rollback-only test.

Recipe JSON includes an authorized `fallback_image_url` for a readable linked canonical photo. React tries that URL if the preferred image request fails, then shows its accessible placeholder; no raw blob/storage identity is exposed and private canonical permissions remain enforced.

## Catalog browsing

The top navigation links to public Ingredients, Utensils and Techniques catalogs. HTML lists search by name with `q`, sort by name and ID, and paginate 24 records at a time. Lazy Turbo Frames load subsequent pages on scroll while retaining the query; each frame includes a normal next-page link. Ingredient and utensil pages expose only usable catalog records. Each result links to its public detail page; techniques retain their slug URLs. Existing JSON catalog lists remain complete for recipe pickers.

Cocktails and the three catalogs share `catalog/index.html.erb` for headings, debounced search, counters, empty states and lazy pagination. Cocktails retain their existing card partial (including the photo fallback) and JSON response. The other catalogs use `catalog/_resource.html.erb`.
